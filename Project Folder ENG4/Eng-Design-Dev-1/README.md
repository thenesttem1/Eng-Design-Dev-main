# Eng-Design-Dev
This is the shared code of our high-school Engineering Design and Development project.

Our project is built off the problem that birds cause large amount of damages to peoples roofs through deficating or urinating and by just tearing up your roof. We are focusing our code towards a Pan and Tilt muchanism designed to detect a bird and move to follow it by using a camera mounted to the top.
